## Introduction
The **So Long** project is a 2D game in which the player controls a character and navigates through a maze to collect items and reach a goal. The goal is to implement a game engine using the MiniLibX library and to manage game mechanics such as player movement, item collection, and level progression.

## Mandatory Part

### Overview
In the mandatory part, you will create a game where the player must navigate a maze to reach the exit. The game involves:
- A maze represented by a grid of characters.
- A player character that can move up, down, left, and right.
- Collectible items that the player needs to gather.
- An exit that the player must reach to win the game.

### Gameplay
- The player controls the character using arrow keys.
- Collectible items are scattered throughout the maze.
- The player wins the game by collecting all items and reaching the exit.

### Compilation and Execution
To compile the project, use the following command:

```bash
make
```

To run the game, execute:

```bash
./so_long map.ber
```

Here, `map.ber` is a file containing the maze layout.

## Bonus Part

### Bonus Overview
The bonus part introduces additional features and complexity to the game, such as animated elements, multiple levels, or new gameplay mechanics.

### Features
- **Animated Player and Enemies:** Add animations to the player character and enemies.
- **Multiple Levels:** Implement a system to navigate through different levels or mazes.
- **Improved Graphics and Sounds:** Enhance the visual and audio aspects of the game.
- **Additional Gameplay Mechanics:** Introduce new features such as traps, power-ups, or a scoring system.

### Compilation and Execution
To compile the bonus part, use the following command:

```bash
make bonus
```

To run the game with bonus features, execute:

```bash
./so_long_bonus map.ber
```
